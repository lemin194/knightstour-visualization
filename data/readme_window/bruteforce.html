<br>
A straightforward approach to solving the Knight's Tour problem.
<br>

<b><font size="5">Algorithm Steps</font></b>
<br>
  - Start with an empty chessboard and an initial position for the knight.
  - Mark the current position as visited.
  - Generate a list of all valid moves from the current position.
  - For each valid move, recursively apply steps 2-4 with the new position as the current position.
  - If a valid tour is found (all squares visited), return the solution.
  - If no valid tour is found, backtrack by undoing the move and continue the search.
  - If all possibilities have been explored and no valid tour is found, conclude that no solution exists.

<b><font size="5">Complexity</font></b>
<br>
  The brute force algorithm has high computational complexity. For an NxN chessboard, the number of move combinations to explore is extremely large. The time complexity is approximately O(8^((n^2)-1)).

<br>
<b><font size="5">Efficiency Considerations</font></b>
<br>
  Due to the exponential growth of possibilities, the brute force algorithm becomes impractical for large board sizes.The algorithm often fail to find a solution in less than 15 minutes with N = 5, since it takes an average of 100,000 steps to find a solution.
