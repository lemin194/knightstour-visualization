<b><font size="5">Introduce</font></b>
<br>
The Warnsdorff's rule is a heuristic approach to solving the Knight's Tour problem.
<br>

<b><font size="5">Algorithm Steps</font></b>
<br>
  - Start with an empty chessboard and an initial position for the knight.
  - Mark the current position as visited.
  - Repeat the following steps until all squares on the board have been visited:
    + For each valid move, count its accessibility, which is the number of unvisited squares that is reachable from that move.
    + Choose the valid move with the less accessibility.
    + If there are multiple squares with equal accessibility, choose the one that is the furthest from the center of the board.
    + Mark the new position as visited.

<b><font size="5">Efficiency and Benefits</font></b>
<br>
The Warnsdorff heuristic improves the efficiency of finding a solution for the Knight's Tour problem.
  - By prioritizing moves with the fewest possible onward moves, it reduces the search space and increases the chances of finding a solution quickly.
  - When N is even, it often find a solution in linear time.
  - When N is odd, sometimes it failed to find a solution quickly and become a regular backtracking.
