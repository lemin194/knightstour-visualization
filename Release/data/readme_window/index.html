<br>
The Knight's Tour problem is a mathematical puzzle where the goal is to find a sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.
<br>

<b><font size="5">How to Use</font></b>
<br>
  - Choose the starting square of the knight and select an algorithm to start.
  - Click the "Start" button to initiate the visualization.

There are 2 algorithms illustrated in this application:
  - <a href='bruteforce'>Brute-force algorithm</a>
<br>
  - <a href='warnsdorff'>Warnsdorff heuristic</a>

<b><font size="5">Note</font></b>
<br>
  - This application only consider NxN boards with
  5<=N<=12, since there is no solution for every N < 5.
  - If N is odd, you must start at a dark square, or there will not be any complete tour at all. Try to explain why!
  - When N is odd, Warnsdorff's heuristic can turn into regular backtrackingm, since it's not guaranteed to find a solution in linear time.
  - Brute-force algorithm often fail to find a solution in less than 15 minutes with N = 5, since it takes an average of 100,000 steps to find a solution.
